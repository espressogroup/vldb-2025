# Exploring the Performance of Scalable Keyword Search on Decentralized Data with Differential Visibility Constraints

[VLDB2025] The source code, data, and other artifacts have been made available for our paper submitted to VLDB 2025 Conference 

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for our paper on scalable search and querying in decentralized data cooperatives with differential data access. We explore decentralized indexing, metadata management, and decentralized ranking techniques to balance query efficiency and privacy. Our experiments, conducted in a healthcare-inspired scenario, show that metadata-driven search in decentralized indexes reduces execution time while maintaining privacy, and achieves retrieval quality comparable to centralized search methods.
